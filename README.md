# Friend_Service
This is a simple implementation of the server part of a computer hardware store.  
To run this project you need to download Docker. Link to the Docker installation: https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/  
If you have Windows, then run the Docker Desktop application.  
Next, you need to go to the WSL terminal or the usual console (Windows) or terminal in Linux, go to the folder in the docker project and from there enter the command "docker-compose up --build" in the terminal.  
The project has assembled and you will need to restart one container. To do this, use the command in the console "docker restart friend_service".  
After that, follow the link "http://localhost:8000/" and use it!
